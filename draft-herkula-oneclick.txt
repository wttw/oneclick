  Signaling "One-Click" functionality for HTTPS URIs in email headers
                             draft-oneclick

Abstract

   This document describes a simplified method for signaling "One-Click"
   functionality for HTTPS URIs as they appear in email headers.  The
   need for this arises out of the fact, that third-party entities
   involved in the processing of emails sometimes unintendedly trigger
   actions that are subject to the user and shall not be triggered
   automatically without an user's intent.

1.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   a.  "One-Click": In the context of this document, describes an HTTPS
       URI that directly triggers a change in a system that shall only
       be applied if the request to that HTTPS URI is done with an
       user's intent.

   b.  "Organizational Domain": Is to be interpreted as described in
       Section 3 of [RFC7489]

   c.  "Domain Alignment": In the context of this document, means that
       two domains share the same organizational domain.

   d.  "signal-constant": fixed string "=One-Click"

2.  Introduction

   An email header can contain HTTPS URIs for extended functionality,
   for example List-Headers [RFC2369].  In case of the List-Unsubscribe
   Header the HTTPS URI is mandated to unsubscribe the recipient of the

   email directly from the list.  This requirement is often not
   implemented because anti-spam solutions request all found external
   resources, this is considered unintended malicious behavior.  In
   consequence senders implement landing pages asking to confirm the
   unsubscribe request.  This specification tries to solve one part of
   this, as it proposes a pattern to detect "One-Click" functionality.
   It defines a specific format for the fragment part of a HTTPS URI and
   a specific transformation for the receiver.  A request to the
   transformed HTTPS URI from somebody who adheres to this specification
   can be distinguished from other requests and therefore handled
   independently.

3.  High-Level Goals

   o  Allow email senders to signal "One-Click" functionality for
      specific HTTPS URIs used in email headers.

   o  Allow MUA owners to implement independent user interface features
      for a better user experience.

   o  Allow MUA users to trigger intended actions in a familiar
      environment.

4.  Out of Scope

   This proposal does not solve problems associated with intended
   malicious behavior by users or robots.

5.  Implementation

5.1.  Sender

   A sending entity which is responsible for the content of an email,
   that wishes to add an actionable HTTPS URI in the header of an email,
   shall add the name of the Header followed by signal-constant, as the
   URI fragment.  The sending entity also needs to provide the
   infrastructure to handle GET and or POST requests to this URI in an
   appropriate volume.

   The "One-Click" action triggered by such URIs must complete in an
   appropriate timeframe and should never burden the requester in an
   inappropriate way.  The sending entity cannot expect that HTTP
   redirects are followed by the requester.

   Repeated requests to the same URI must be handled like all other
   requests.

5.2.  Receiver

   A receiving entity which wants to use a HTTPS URI that signals "One-
   Click" functionality, shall take the key-value pair out of the
   fragment part of the URI and add it as additional URI key-value
   parameter to the corresponding URI before requesting it.  The
   receiving entity shall not request the HTTPS URI without user
   consent.  When and how the user consent is obtained is not part of
   this specification.  The Request must use the HTTP verbs GET or POST,
   other verbs are not permitted as especially the HEAD request should
   never be used in cases where a state change is triggered.  PUT and
   DELETE would offer similar functionality but are often not
   implemented correctly or are not implemented at all.

   The requester should not follow redirects and should interpret all
   3xx HTTP status codes as a success signal.

5.3.  Additional Requirements

   The email needs at least one valid authentication identifier, in this
   version of the specification the only supported identifier type is
   DKIM [RFC7489], that provides a domain-level identifier in the
   content of the "d=" tag of a validated DKIM-Signature header field.

   The corresponding header needs to be included in the "h=" tag of a
   valid DKIM-Signature header field.

   The domain used in the HTTPS URI shall align to the domain used in
   the RFC5322.From field or to the domain in the "d=" tag of the valid
   DKIM-Signature header field in which the header is listed in the "h="
   tag.

6.  Examples

6.1.  Simple

   This example signals "One-Click" functionality for the List-
   Unsubscribe Header.

      List-Unsubscribe: <https://example.com/unsubscribe.html#List-
      Unsubscribe=One-Click>

   A mailbox provider shall request that HTTPS URI in this form:

      https://example.com/unsubscribe.html?List-Unsubscribe=One-Click

6.2.  Extended

   This link already has parameters.

      List-Unsubscribe: <https://example.com/
      unsubscribe.html?campaign=123456789#List-Unsubscribe=One-Click>

   A mailbox provider shall request that HTTPS URI in this form:

      https://example.com/unsubscribe.html?campaign=123456789&List-
      Unsubscribe=One-Click
